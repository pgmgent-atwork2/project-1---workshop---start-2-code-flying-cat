# Flying Tiger 2023  
for @work2  
Our game is inspired by Flappy Bird, but it's a little bit different, and more beautiful as well  
It's about a cute flying tiger that has a beautiful rainbow in his ....., the more holes you get through the more points you earn.  
Once you hit a wall, your game is over, click on ok so you can start again.
